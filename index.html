	<p>I like getting outdoors and having fun in beautiful places. I also like trying to understand how the world works, 
	specifically how protein folding influences health and disease. 
	I'm a research scientist at The Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California, working on AL amyloidosis.</p>
