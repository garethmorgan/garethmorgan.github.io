Hello. I'm a scientist studying rare diseases who enjoys being outdoors. I live in San Diego, California.

I have accounts at the usual collection of social network sites, some of which I use more than others. 
If you know me then my [Facebook profile](http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=671275342) may accept friend requests. 
But it's sufficiently buggy and insecure that I don't know from day to day how well locked down that is. 
I'm [@wittyremarkhere on Twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/wittyremarkhere) (see the feed below), which I mostly use for sciency things. 
I have a vague suspicion that [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/gareth-morgan/1/aa8/b01) will one day prove to be useful for something, but I don't really know what that might be yet. 
I have an intermittently-updated [Tumblr](http://blog.garethmorgan.net/). It's mostly my [Instagram feed](https://www.instagram.com/garethjmorgan/) at the moment. 
And I have some pictures online at [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/garethmorgan/).
