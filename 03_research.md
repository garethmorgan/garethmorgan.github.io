### I'm trying to understand a disease called AL amyloidosis, 
with the goal of improving diagnosis and finding treatments 
for a disease that's difficult to treat and often fatal.

I work at [The Scripps Research Institute](https://www.scripps.edu) with 
[Professor Jeff Kelly](https://www.scripps.edu/kelly/). We study antibody 
light chain proteins, looking for differences that might explain why some 
protein sequences are tolerated by the body, while others aggregate 
to make amyloid fibrils, such as those below.

We recently [published a paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283616303400) 
describing my work, which is [described in less technical terms here](../research/light_chain_dimers).
 We found that light chains associated with disease 
are less stable than other light chains. This means that they can be cut 
into fragments by proteases, and those fragments - but not the intact 
proteins - can form amyloid. We're now looking for ways to stabilize 
disease-associated proteins in patients, which we think might relieve 
their symptoms.
