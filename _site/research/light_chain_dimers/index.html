  <h1 class="post-title">Light chains hold themselves together to avoid amyloidosis</h1>
  <span class="post-date">18 Oct 2016</span>
  <p>I work on a rare disease called <a href="http://www.amyloidosis.org/facts/al/">light chain amyloidosis</a>
or AL amyloidosis. 
For the last couple of years, I&#39;ve been working on trying to understand why some 
people get the disease, and what we can do to prevent it. 
Here&#39;s what we&#39;ve found so far.</p>

<p>Everyone has a type of protein called free 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_light_chain">light chains</a> in
their blood. Light chains are components of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody">antibodies</a>,
 and free light chains are a by-product of antibody production without any known
biological role. In most people, these proteins are removed degraded by
the kidneys, but in rare cases they can stick together to form large
assemblies called amyloid fibrils, 
causing a disease called AL amyloidosis. (This is a precise but complicated 
<a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3109/13506129.2014.964858">nomenclature</a>, where “AL”
stands for “amyloid light chain”, so the disease is strictly “amyloid
light chain amyloidosis”.) We want to understand why some light chains
cause disease while others are benign. Our work suggested a new factor
that might be involved, and the 
<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283616303400">paper describing our findings</a> 
has just been published. <a href="../assets/papers/Morgan_Kelly_LC_dimer_stability_JMB_2016.pdf">Here is a version</a> (pdf, 2.4 Mb) for anyone who cannot access the
paper via the journal. We found that light chains associated with
amyloidosis are less stable than other light chains, which makes them
more susceptible to being cut into fragments that can form amyloid
fibrils. </p>

<p>The underlying cause of AL amyloidosis is an imbalance in
plasma cells, which are bone marrow cells that produce antibodies. 
This can lead to a blood cancer called 
<a href="http://www.cancer.org/cancer/multiplemyeloma/detailedguide/multiple-myeloma-what-is-multiple-myeloma">multiple myeloma</a>, 
but if the light chains produced by the plasma
cells are especially prone to forming amyloid fibrils, then the amyloid
can cause organ damage before the cancer starts to cause problems
itself. AL amyloidosis can be treated by killing the cancerous cells,
but many patients are too sick to cope with the chemotherapy. This is
partly because AL amyloidosis is rare and hard to diagnose. By the time
doctors identify it, patients are often very ill, especially if the
amyloid is affecting their heart. Our research suggests a potential way
to identify people at risk from amyloidosis – those with unstable light
chains – and also a way that we might be able to treat patients, by
stabilizing their light chains with drug molecules. </p>

<p>Light chains can
form dimers, where the two identical protein chains are held together by
a disulfide bond. Those two chains are built from two domains, a
“constant” domain that is similar between light chains, and a “variable”
domain whose sequence is unique to each antibody. In AL amyloidosis,
each patient has a unique light chain sequence, which may influence the
very varied way in which the disease progresses. There has been a lot of
work on AL amyloidosis, trying to understand why some light chains are
associated with disease but others are not. Several researchers have
looked at differences between variable domains, and seen that those
associated with amyloidosis are less stable than other variable domains.
One way to measure this is to look at how readily the purified variable
domains form amyloid fibrils in a test tube. Amyloidosis-associated
variable domains tend to aggregate faster than other variable domains.
But the differences are subtle. And studying the variable domain begs
the question, what about the full-length protein, the form that’s
actually made by cells? </p>

<p>We started looking at light chains in the
context of secretion from cells. We found that the secretion of less
stable, amyloidogenic light chains is more sensitive than that of
non-amyloidogenic light chains to changes in cell stress. We next asked
whether the full-length light chains that we were working with would
behave in a similar way to the variable domains. I expected that the
amyloidogenic light chain would aggregate faster than its
non-amyloidogenic counterpart. I was wrong. Neither light chain
aggregated under any of the conditions that I tried. It took a while
before I really believed what I was measuring. Science thrives on this
kind of “that’s weird” moments, but the usual explanation is that you’re
doing something wrong. So I compared the aggregation of the full-length
light chains to their isolated variable domains to make sure that at
least some of the proteins that I was making could form amyloid. The
results were quite clear. Variable domains from both amyloidogenic and
non-amyloidogenic light chains would form beautiful amyloid fibrils
simply by shaking in physiological conditions for a few hours. But as
part of a full-length dimer, even the most amyloidogenic variable
domains would not aggregate after a month of shaking. This suggests that
light chain dimers have evolved to lock themselves into an inert state
that won’t aggregate – which fits with the fact that everyone has these
proteins in their blood. So perhaps something needs to break apart the
dimer to start the process of aggregation that leads to amyloidosis. </p>

<p>A key observation from amyloidosis patients provided a clue to what was
happening: amyloid deposits in the body often contain fragments of light
chains, including variable domains. This was what had started people
looking at differences between variable domains in the first place, but
it has never been clear whether the light chains are broken up
(presumably by protein-cutting enzymes called proteases) before or after
they aggregate. So maybe this “proteolysis” was important. We measured
the stability of several light chains and saw that the
disease-associated light chains were much less stable than the others,
and could be cut up into fragments by proteases more rapidly. We also 
saw that disrupting the interface that joins the two light chains 
together to make the dimer makes them less stable. Finally,
we showed that we could trigger aggregation by cutting the light chain
between the constant and variable domains. This released the variable
domain from the unstable light chain, breaking the stabilizing
interaction that kept it soluble. </p>

<p>We think that this might be
playing a role in AL amyloidosis. Amyloid formation might
start when unstable light chains are broken into fragments that can go
on to aggregate, but that this is much less likely to happen to the
stable light chains that most of us have in our blood. One thing that I
like about this model is that it fits with many years of observations on
different systems. What’s potentially more important is that it suggests
two things that might help amyloidosis patients if they hold true for
other light chains. First, by measuring the stability of someone’s light
chains, we might be able to predict whether they’re at risk of
amyloidosis, potentially helping to diagnose them earlier. Second, if
there’s a way to stabilize light chains, that might help patients who
can’t currently be treated. The big question here is whether our
observations, on six light chain sequences out of the hundreds known to
be associated with disease, is generally true. So that’s what I’m
working towards now. Our work suggests a strategy that might possibly
prove to be useful for treating a deadly disease. We’re a long way from
helping patients, but we have a way forward that might get us there one
day. In the meantime, there’s more information and advice about
amyloidosis on the website of the 
<a href="http://www.amyloidosis.org/">Amyloidosis Foundation</a>, who provided
some of the funding that got this research going.  </p>
